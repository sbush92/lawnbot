# lawnbot

lawnbot is a lawn cutting robot simulation

## Installation

The node-sass dependency is required for compiling sass css: `npm install node-sass`

To compile the sass on-the-fly, run `npn run sass`. This will launch the sass compiler and run it in the background, continuously detecting changes in scss files and compiling them to css files.

Development was done with Visual Studio Code. The live server plugin was used to help with on-the-fly development changes.
